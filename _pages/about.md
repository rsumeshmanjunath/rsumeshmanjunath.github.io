# Vanakam / Hello!

I am Sumesh Manjunath Ramesh, a Ph.D. candidate at [Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, USA](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Hoda AlKhzaimi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-hoda-a-alkhzaimi-b36a3910b/). My broad research lies at the intersection of applied cryptography, hardware implementation, and side-channel analysis. I am advancing the state of the art in symmetric cryptography.

I am also a recipient of the [NYUAD Global Ph.D. Student Fellowship in Engineering](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/admissions/graduate/global-phd-student-fellowships-in-engineering.html). Hence, I have had the opportunity to conduct my research work from the New York University Abu Dhabi campus, where my advisor's primary affiliation is located.

I completed a [Master in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Information Security](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/info-sec) from [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, INDIA](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/). My interest in cryptography was sparked after attending lectures by [Prof. Somitra Kumar Sanadhya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/somitra-sanadhya-4556a41/). The introduction to provable security came from [Prof. Donghoon Chang](http://www.donghoon.us/), and I am indebted to both of them throughout my life.

During my Master's program, I conducted research under their guidance on Authenticated Encryption modes for my thesis. This work was recognized as the Best M.Tech Thesis among the 11 theses submitted in 2013 at IIIT Delhi.

Between my Master's and Ph.D., I gained valuable experience in applied research on real-world problems at TCS Research, INDIA. I joined the Applied Algorithms and Optimization Research Group under [Dr. Sachin Lodha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachin-lodha-8ba2991/), one of the finest managers I have worked with. It was a privilege to be mentored by him, and I learned the intricacies of applied research, producing pragmatic results for the organization.

After working with Dr. Sachin Lodha for a few years, I transitioned from TCS Research, Pune, INDIA, to TCS Research, Bengaluru, INDIA. Here, I focused on developing a Blockchain consensus framework for a private blockchain in an enterprise setting.
